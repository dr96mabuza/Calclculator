## Description
The culmination of The Odin Project foundations course is a straightforward calculator project that emphasizes the creation of tidy code, implementation of CSS flexbox, and manipulation of HTML and JavaScript for DOM manipulation and Events.

## Issues
  - web app size is only made for desktop and not mobile or tablet.
  - can not solve and display values after a second operator has been added.
      eg
      - 1 + 1 - 1 should display 2 - 1 first and then 0.
